## Summary

react-message app is a real-time messaging application built using the React framework and integrated with Google Sign-In through Google's Firebase serverless system. The application allows users to communicate with each other in real-time, enabling instant messaging between connected individuals.

The frontend of the application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture and efficient rendering mechanism make it ideal for creating responsive and interactive user interfaces, crucial for a real-time messaging application.

The Google Sign-In feature is seamlessly integrated into the React IM application using Google's Firebase serverless system. Firebase provides a set of backend services, including authentication, real-time database, and cloud functions, without the need to manage server infrastructure. Google Sign-In allows users to sign in to the React IM app securely using their Google credentials, streamlining the authentication process and providing a seamless user experience.
